						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p>Bogdan is a philosopher and logician who, for the purposes of this website, acquired the disturbing habit of speaking of himself in the third person.</p>
							<p><s>Currently, Bogdan is a postdoc at the <a href="http://unica.it">University of Cagliari</a>, where he works in the <a href="http://people.unica.it/alophis/">ALOPHIS</a> research group.</s></p>
								<p><s>Bogdan moved! As of September 2017, he's a postdoc at the <a href="http://cful.letras.ulisboa.pt">Centre for Philosophy</a> of the <a href="http://www.ulisboa.pt">University of Lisbon</a></s>.</p>
							<p>As of the 1st of January 2024 Bogdan joined the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/socialsciences/philosophy/">Philosophy Department of the University of the Witwatersrand</a> in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>	
							<p> Before becoming a humble proletarian, Bogdan obtained his PhD from the <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au">University of Melbourne</a> with a thesis on logical pluralism written under the supervision of <a href="http://consequently.org">Greg Restall</a>.</p>
 							<p>What the future will bring, no one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBBeTHrG6Cs">knows</a>.</p>
							<p>Bogdan is <s>also</s> no longer on <a href="https://twitter.com/bdicher">twitter</a> and he has a different instagram account than the one linked here <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bdicher/">instagram</a></span> (though he forgot his password). Bogdan blogs <a href="http://bdicher.me//post">here</a>.</p>
								<p>Bogdan is a member of several professional associations, but doesn't keep track of which, with the effect that he rarely pays his dues. He is certain about being a member of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aalogic/">Australasian Association for Logic</a>, which, fortunately, does not keep a record of its members and does not charge membership fees. He was never inducted to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aalogic/curios/logicians-liberation-league">Logicians Liberation League</a>, although he is seldom <i>not</i> in the company of several of its members! (He is, however, affiliated with the Deviant Logic Posse.)</p>

										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Mind</i> (125(499):727-757; doi:10.1093/mind/fzv214)</p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: In this paper I offer a proof-theoretic defence of meaning-invariant logical pluralism. I argue that there is a relation of co-determination between the operational and structural aspects of a logic. As a result, some features of the consequence relation are induced by the connectives. I propose that a connective is defined by those rules which are conservative and unique, while at the same time expressing only connective-induced structural information. This is the key to stabilizing the meaning of the connectives across multiple determinations of the consequence relation.</p>

										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>The Review of Symbolic Logic</i> (9(3):583-602; doi:10.1017/S1755020316000162)</p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: A logical constant is weakly disharmonious if its elimination rules are weaker than its introduction rules. Substructural weak disharmony is the weak disharmony generated by structural restrictions on the eliminations. I argue that substructural weak disharmony is not a defect of the constants which exhibit it. To the extent that it is problematic, it calls into question the structural properties of the derivability relation. This prompts us to rethink the issue of controlling the structural properties of a logic by means of harmony. I argue that such a control is possible and desirable. Moreover, it is best achieved by global tests of harmony.</p>

										<p><b>What about</b>:
										The strict-tolerant (ST) approach to paradox promises to erect theories of naïve truth and tolerant vagueness on the safe bedrock of classical logic. We assess the extent to which this claim is founded. Building on some results by Girard [11], we show that the usual proof-theoretic formulation of propositional ST in terms of the classical sequent calculus without primitive Cut is incomplete with respect to ST-valid metainferences, and exhibit a complete calculus for the same class of metainferences. We also argue that the latter calculus, far from coinciding with classical logic, is a close kin of Priest’s LP.</p>

				<div class="cbp-ntcontent">													<p><b>When:</b> 2017</p>
					<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Theoria</i></p>
					<p><b>What about</b>: Recently, Nissim Francez defended a generality condition on defining rules in proof-theoretic semantics, according to which the schematic formulation of the defining rules must be maximally general. (See his wonderful book, <i>Proof-theoretic semantics</i>.) Context variables must always be present in the schematic rules and they should range over arbitrary collections of formulae. Moreover, no restrictions must be placed on the contexts of these rules. I argue against imposing such a condition.</p>

					<p><b>What about</b>: Arguments are usually understood as having one or more premises and only one conclusion. However, this notion of argument can be generalised and we may let arguments have not one, but several disjunctively connected conclusions. This is a contentious generalisation. In this paper I will argue that it is, nonetheless, justified. I argue that multiple conclusions are epiphenomena of the logical connectives. That is, I argue that some connectives induces multiple-conclusion derivations. In this sense, such derivations are completely natural. Moreover, I argue that they can safely be used in the proof-theoretic semantics.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Variations on intra-theoretical logical pluralism: Internal vs. external consequence</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p><b>When:</b> forthcoming 2018</p>
										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Philosophical Studies</i></p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: Intra-theoretical logical pluralism is a form of meaning-invariant pluralism about logic, articulated recently by Hjortland (2013). This version of pluralism relies on it being possible to define several distinct notions of provability relative to the same logical calculus. The present paper picks up and explores this theme: How can a single logical calculus express several different consequence relations? The main hypothesis articulated here is that the divide between the internal and external consequence relations in Gentzen systems generates a form of intra-theoretical logical pluralism.

									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p><b>When:</b> forthcoming</p>
										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Synthese</i></p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: 
Proof-theoretic semantics is an alternative to model-theoretic seman- tics. It aims at explaining the meaning of the logical constants in terms of the inference rules that govern their behaviour in proofs. We argue that this must be construed as the task of explaining these meanings relative to a logic, i.e., to a consequence relation. Alas, there is no agreed set of properties that a relation must have in order to qualify as a consequence relation. Moreover, the association of a consequence relation to a logical calculus is not as straightforward as it may seem. We show that these facts are problematic for the proof-theoretic project but the problems can be solved. Our thesis is that the consequence relation relevant for proof- theoretic semantics is the one given be the sequent-to-sequent derivability relation in Gentzen systems.

										<p><b>When:</b> forthcoming (accepted 2019)</p>
										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Analysis</i></p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: 
										
											On a bilateralist reading, sequents are interpreted as statements to the effect that, given the assertion of the antecedent it is incoherent to deny the succedent. This interpretation goes against its own ecumenical ambitions, endowing Cut with a meaning very close to that of tertium non datur and thus rendering it intuitionistically unpalatable. This paper explores a top-down route for arguing that, even intuitionistically, a prohibition to deny is as strong as a license to assert.

										<p><b>When:</b> forthcoming (accepted 2019)</p>
										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Dialectica</i></p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: 
											Reflective equilibrium, as a methodology for the `formation of logics', fails on the fringe, i.e., where intricate details can make or break a logical theory. On the fringe, the process of theorification cannot be methodologically governed by anything like reflective equilibrium. When logical theorising gets tricky, there is nothing on the pre-theoretical side on which our theoretical claims can reflect of -- at least not in any meaningful way. Indeed, the fringe is exclusively the domain of theoretical negotiations
and the methodological power of reflective equilibrium is merely nominal.

									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p>Bogdan will teach a <em>Tutorial on Proof-Theoretis Semantics</em> at the <em> 4th International Autumn School on Proof Theory</em> which will take place between the 7th and the 10th November at the University of Utrecht. More information about the event is available <a href="https://www.proofsociety.org/autumn-school-2022/">here</a>. Click around that page to find more about the Society.

								<p> Proof-theoretic semantics (PTS) is an inferentialist theory of meaning which originates in the work of Gentzen in the 1930s and was subsequently devel- oped by Prawitz, Martin-Lof, Dummett, and more recently by Schroeder-Heister, who also baptised the theory, and many others. It is an alternative to Tarskian model-theoretic semantics, aiming to explain the meaning of the logical constants in terms of the rules of inference that govern their behaviour in proofs.
The orthodox version of PTS, developed against the background of natural deduction, can be described as an extended attempt to develop Gentzen’s suggestion that ‘the introduction [rules] represent, as it were, the ‘definitions’ of the [logical constants], and the eliminations are no more [...] than the consequences of these definitions’. At its core lies the notion of harmony: a kind of balance between the relative strength of the introductions and eliminations of a logical constant that testifies to their successfully defining a logical constant. The quest for a formal property that accurately captures the intuitive notion of harmony has dominated much of PTS. Said quest is the source of less orthodox versions of PTS. By and large, these retain the focus on harmony, while taking revisionary stances with respect to other aspects of orthodox PTS, such as the priority of the standard assertionist setting of PTS, or of natural deduction.
The first part of the tutorial will critically discuss orthodox PTS, focusing on the development of different conceptions of harmony and their con- nection with formal properties of Gentzen-style calculi, such as reducibility, invertibility and normalizability or cut-elimination.
The second part of the tutorial is devoted to less orthodox stances in PTS. We will first look at bilateralist versions of the programme, which put denial on a par with assertion and thus introduce a new dimension of harmony, between the conditions for asserting and, respectively, denying a sentence. Finally, we will look at versions of PTS that take the sequent calculus as the framework of choice for specifying definitional rules for the logical connectives. We will explore the motivation(s) for going down this path and some results obtained within this framework.</p>

							<p>How do you feel about the musical version of it? Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tera1tRYI7Y">here</a>. Well, Bogdan may have exagerated when doctoring it: for one thing, he can't whistle. (Oh, you don't like opera?

							<p><b>The short version</b> is</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y0IROfgJbo">here</a>.</p>
							<p><b>The technical aspects.</b> This site is made with <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> - so Bogdan <i>borrowed</i> <a href="http://rohan-french.github.io/">Rohan's</a> idea of stealing <a href="http://consequently.org">consequently's</a> idea. Using Hugo was quite unnecessary: Bogdan soon realised that he needs to write a theme. For that, he'd have had to understand the syntax of Go. But his procrastination needs are nowhere near so complex. So, he went over to <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a>, lawfully appropriated <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/03/29/nested-accordion/">this template</a>, and cheerfully (and mercilessly) hacked the css and html provided. By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7trldSOwvoA">Paris</a>, you should enjoy the result: the colour scheme of the previous live version was inspired by the rainbow lorikeet.</p>
							<p><b>The grand perspective.</b> It's grand but simple and elaborated by <a href="http://john.jperry.net/">John Perry</a>. Bogdan had bucketloads of work to do, so he decided to revive his website.</p>
